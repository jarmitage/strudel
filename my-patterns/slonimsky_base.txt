// Beyond Slonimsky: Melodic Patterns for Guitar, Rich Cochrane, p.3
// Slonimsky's first recipe works as follows. 
// First take a certain number of octaves. 
// Then divide them into equal parts: 
// the first note of each part goes into the 'base'. 
// That's all there is to it. 
// Slonimsky is interested in all the possible ways to do this.

let start = 48
